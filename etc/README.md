These files are example configurations for haproxy and keepalived, which loadbalance the kube-apiserver pods on a floating IP that the keepalived hosts manage.  This is required for having an HA kube control plane and can be accomplished via other loadbalancers (relayd, Amazon ELB, etc...).  As this repo applies to an on-prem k8s installation (i.e. no cloud loadbalancers and running on Linux instead of OpenBSD), haproxy and keepalived are supplied.  Other software load balancer configs can be added in the future if there is interest.
